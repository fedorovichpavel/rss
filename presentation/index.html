                <ul>
                    <li>React - is a JS library for building user interfaces.</li>
                    <li>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.</li>
                    <li>Initially, React was intended for the web, for creating websites, but later the React Native platform appeared, which was already intended for mobile devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>React is a perfect tool for building scalable web applications.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment">The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or "virtual", representaton of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called <strong>reconciliation</strong>.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state.</li>

                        <li class="fragment">Rather than touching the DOM directly, we,re building an abstract version of it. That's it. We working with some kind of lightweight copy of our DOM. We can change it as we want and then save to our real DOM tree. While saving
                            we should compare, find difference and change (re-render) what should be changed.</li>
                        <li class="fragment">It is much faster than working directly with DOM, because it doesn't require all the heavyweight parts that go into a real DOM.</li>

                        used by various preprocessors to transform these tokens into standart ECMAScript.</li>

                        <li class="fragment"><strong>Changes are made with pure functions:</strong><br>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.</li>

                <h2>Finally</h2>
                <p>In essence, the ReactJS interface is different than other js libraries which are more imperative, meaning you tell them to change the DOM directly. Jquery is like this. ReactJS is more like: here is my state, and here is how you should
                    interpret my state and how it will change. Now, I can sit back and let ReactJS handle the expensive and complicated task of making this visible to the user in the browser.</p>
